# SnapshotView

The SnapshotView control allows users to draw a bounding box inside a scenegraph (or typically in an ImageView).

This bounding box represents the dimensions of their selection, and from which an image can be created of the selected area.
This is another of those controls that is easier to describe with an image, so, see below! ðŸ™‚
