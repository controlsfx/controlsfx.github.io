# SegmentedButton
When you have a ToggleGroup with buttons in it, it looks nicer when the buttons are grouped together (rather than individual buttons).

This is exactly what the [SegmentedButton]({{< javadocurl >}}/org/controlsfx/control/SegmentedButton.html) control does - 
it ‘merges’ together all of your buttons in a ToggleGroup so that it is clear to users that the buttons are related.
