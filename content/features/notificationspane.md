# NotificationPane

The [NotificationPane]({{< javadocurl >}}/org/controlsfx/control/NotificationPane.html) control allows you to notify your users of something without requiring their immediate input.
The NotificationPane will animate in and out of view, and provides support for an arbitrarily complex ‘graphic’ property (put any Node in there), as well as text, and an area to place control buttons.
It also supports two visual styles, continuing in our theme of providing light and dark styles.
