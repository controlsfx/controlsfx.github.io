# PropertySheet

[PropertySheet]({{< javadocurl >}}/org/controlsfx/control/PropertySheet.html) is a vertical list of properties that can be edited with a number of pre-build editors.
We support string, number, boolean, enumeration, color, and font editors.
As well as supporting the built-in editors, you can provide custom editors for your specific use cases.
