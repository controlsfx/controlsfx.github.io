# ListSelectionView

A control used to perform a multi-selection via the help of two list views.
Items can be moved from one list (source) to the other (target). This can be done by either double-clicking on the list items or by using one of the “move” buttons between the two lists.

Each list can be decorated with a header and a footer node.
The default header nodes are simply two labels: "Available" and "Selected".
