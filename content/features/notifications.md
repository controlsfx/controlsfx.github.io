# Notifications

ControlsFX has had the NotificationPane feature for a release or two now, but that required that the notification appear within the window.
Some use cases are to simply inform the user of an event, even when the main window itself is not visible (or focused) – think email notifications, for example.
This is where the Notifications class comes in – it will show a notification message to users in one of nine locations on the screen, and even supports stacking multiple notifications, and showing complex scenegraphs.
After a set duration, the notification will fade out.
