# CheckComboBox / CheckListView / CheckTreeView

All three controls offer the same functionality – support for checking zero or more items in a ComboBox, ListView, or a TreeView, and being able to easily retrieve the checked items from an underlying ‘check model’.
These were already easily doable using standard JavaFX APIs, but this takes it a step further by automatically tracking the checkbox selections for you. Here’s a screenshot of each of the new controls:
