# PopOver

The PopOver control is designed to provide information to users in a visually pleasing way that does not interfere with their workflow.
It is hard to explain, but hopefully the screenshot below better summarises the functionality:

Of course, a PopOver with no content is a little sad, so hereâ€™s a screenshot of one with content inside it.
Note that this is using a custom TitledPane style that presently doesn't ship with ControlsFX (but that you can create with a little CSS):
