# Decoration / Validation

ControlsFX has a decoration framework to allow developers to apply decorations to nodes on screen.
For example, you may want to show graphics in the corner of your nodes, or add a styleclass in certain circumstances.
The decoration framework makes this kind of action trivial.
However, to be fair, the decoration framework was primarily developed to be the visual feedback mechanism for a validation framework, and we have one of those in ControlsFX too!

The validation framework is designed to be lightweight, but will grow over time as developers suggest desired functionality (we are definitely open to suggestions!).

Here are two screenshots:
