# RangeSlider

When you want a user to specify a range, right now you need to give them two text fields to type into (or two sliders). Yuck!

The [RangeSlider]({{< javadocurl >}}/org/controlsfx/control/RangeSlider.html) control is essentially the standard JavaFX slider but with two draggable thumbs on it â€“ one representing the low value and the other the high value. Much better!
