# TextFields

ControlsFX ships with a few useful TextField-related controls.

## AutoComplete TextField

It can provide suggestions to users as they type into it. The popup will only show options based on the currently typed input.

## TextFields

In addition, there is API to make it really easy for you to customise a TextField (or PasswordField) by placing nodes within the text area.
There are also pre-built features such as clearable fields that show a little cross that clears the text when deleted.

Hereâ€™s a screenshot:
