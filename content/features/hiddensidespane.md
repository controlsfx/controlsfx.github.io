# HiddenSidesPane

A pane used to display a full-size content node and four initially hidden nodes on the four sides.
The hidden nodes can be made visible by moving the mouse cursor to the edges of the pane.
The hidden node will appear (at its preferred width or height) with a short slide-in animation.
The node will disappear again as soon as the mouse cursor exits it.
A hidden node / side can also be pinned, and it will remain visible as long as it stays pinned.
