# World Map View

A simple map view showing either the entire world or a list of countries. The view is not capable of displaying detailed map information.
The view is based on simple SVG data found in a properties file of the ControlsFX distribution.

A big advantage of this approach is the fact that the view can be run without a network connection.
In addition to showing countries or the world the view can also show locations.
The map can be customized by specifying custom factories for the country and location views.
