# Translations

ControlsFX has externalised all translatable strings. Therefore, the community can help to translate these strings into their local languages.

ControlsFX is currently being [translated to almost 50 languages](https://www.transifex.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/)! 

Hopefully in future versions we can take that number even higher, but for now we really do have an excellent amount of language coverage.
